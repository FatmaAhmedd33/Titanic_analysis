# Titanic_analysis
Project Overview
Objective: Analyze the Titanic dataset to understand factors influencing passenger survival.

Dataset: Contains information about passengers, including age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

Steps Performed
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values (e.g., filled nulls in age and embarked).

Fixed incorrect data types (e.g., converted age to int).

Removed duplicate rows and corrected inconsistencies.

Outlier Detection:

Used the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and handle outliers in numerical columns like age and fare.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized data distributions using histograms, box plots, and KDE plots.

Asked and answered key questions:

What is the overall survival rate?

How does survival vary by gender, class, and age group?

Did passengers traveling alone have a lower survival rate?

Insights:

Women and children had a significantly higher survival rate.

First-class passengers were more likely to survive.

Passengers who paid higher fares had a better chance of survival.

Visualizations:

Created clear and engaging visuals using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Applied warm color palettes (YlOrRd, Oranges, Reds) for professional-looking plots.
